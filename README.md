# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction-Classification-Project

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that will determine whether clients who have previously purchased health insurance will indicate interest in doing the same when it comes to obtaining vehicle insurance. The classification model seeks to make precise predictions using a dataset that includes customer traits, vehicle specifics, and policy information.

## Dataset
The project's dataset is titled "TRAIN-HEALTH INSURANCE CROSS SELL PREDICTION.csv." It has 12 columns, 381,109 rows, and no missing values. It includes a range of characteristics, such as demographic data (gender, age, and area code type), vehicle information (vehicle age, damage), and policy specifics (premium, sourcing channel).

## Methodology
Multiple ML models are used to handle the categorization task. Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier are the models used for this project. The performance of the Logistic Regression model is not enhanced through hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV. The models are evaluated using criteria including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
The Random Forest Classifier is determined to be the most efficient classifier after a thorough analysis. It gives thorough evaluation metrics and has outstanding accuracy. The insurance provider can find potential clients who are more likely to be interested in vehicle insurance by using the model's predictions. As a result, this marketing effort optimisation improves customer acquisition and retention methods.
